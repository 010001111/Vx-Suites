[size=large][color=#1E90FF][b]About:[/b][/color][/size]
After months of pushing from customers and spectators of AthenaIRC alike, AthenaHTTP has finally been coded and completed. This new bot is very similar to AthenaIRC in functionality, however communication with the Command&Control hub is done through means of HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) instead of IRC(Internet Relay Chat).

[b]Athena[/b] is a stable DDoS bot coded in C++ (zero dependencies) perfect for infecting and herding Windows machines. This bot features some of the best, most advanced DDoS tactics available on the market that will take down webservers, gaming servers, teamspeak/VoiP servers, home connections, etc with ease. It is resistant to botkilling, and will kill most other bots available.

The bot comes equipped with:
[color=#1E90FF]-[/color] Botkiller capable of wiping out bots such as Andromeda, Zeus, SpyEye, Insomnia, SmokeLoader, ngrBot, etc...
[color=#1E90FF]-[/color] 10 methods of DDoS, the same tactics used in AthenaIRC(some of the strongest DDoS tactics available on the market)
[color=#1E90FF]-[/color] A built-in website checker that utilizes bots, not unlike hyperspin.com or just-ping.com
[color=#1E90FF]-[/color] SmartView/normal view/view hidden(from random existing brower)
[color=#1E90FF]-[/color] In-depth statistics about each bot
[color=#1E90FF]-[/color] Download/Update/Uninstall
[color=#1E90FF]-[/color] Shell commands(because you never know)
