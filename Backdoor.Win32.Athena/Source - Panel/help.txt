<b>DDoS Panel:</b>
	<u>Details</u>:
	This page is dedicated to the creation of DDoS attacks. Athena Bot supports 10 different kinds of DDoS(2 Layer4, 8 Layer7).

	<u>Additional Information:</u>
	-You can run Browser-Based attacks concurrently with non-Browser-Based attacks.
	-When filling out the DDoS Panel form, make sure you fill it out properly. Improper filling of the form will result in a non-functional attack.
	-Pay attention to the amount of busy/free bots. Better awareness of those statistics make coordination of attacks easier.
	
	<u>Attack Types:</u>
	
	Layer 7(Application layer floods)...
	Slowloris: Attacks a target webserver with many concurrent connections
	Rapid HTTP GET: Sends mass amounts of randomized and realistic GET packets to a given target
	RUDY(r-u-dead-yet): Slowly posts content by the masses to a target webserver
	Rapid HTTP POST: Sends mass amounts of randomized and realistic POST packets to a given target
	Slow HTTP POST: Holds many concurrent connections to a webserver through POST methods
	ARME(Apache Remote Memory Exhaustion): Abuses partial content headers in order to harm a target webserver
	Bandwith: This is a download based flood targetted torwards larger files and downloadable content on websites
	
	Layer 4(Transport Layer floods)...
	UDP: Sends mass amounts of packets containing random data to a target host/ip
	ECF(Established Connection Flood): Floods a target with rapid connections and disconnections (Also known as SSYN in other software)
		
		
<b>Website Checker:</b>
	<u>Details</u>:
	This feature is for testing the status of websites. It utilizes bots as test-servers and will display the HTTP-Status-Codes(<a href=http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html>http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html</a>) retrieved from each bot that tested the website.

	<u>Additional Information:</u>
	-Website Checks work just like commands.
	-These can be restarted or cancelled in the 'Active Commands' page. (Admins only)

	
<b>Create Command:</b>
	<u>Details</u>:
	This is where all other command creation happens(Download&Execute, Download&Execute[with arguments], Update, View, View Hidden, Add/Remove/Clear SmartView, Start/Stop Botkiller, Shell Commands, and Uninstallation).

	<u>Additional Information:</u>
	-Detailed filters located on the command creation page are useful for sending commands to specific types of bots. These filters include: Country, Operating System, CPU Architecture, Computer Type, Bot Version, .NET Version, Admin/User, and Specific Bot Id.
	-Make sure to fill all fields properly. Failure to fill the fields properly will result in a non-functional command.

	
<b>Active Commands:</b>
	<u>Details</u>:
	The Active Commands page displays all currently running commands including commands created on the 'DDoS Panel' page, 'Website Checker' page, and 'Create Command' page.

	<u>Additional Information:</u>

<b>Extra Tips:</b>
-It is good to try a variety of different floods when trying to take a website offline, as different servers are more-vulnerable to different kinds of floods
-ECF and UDP floods are best for servers hosting gameservers, VoiP, TeamSpeak, IRC, etc.
-Play with the bot a bit and become familiar with it. Using it will eventually become much easier and fluent.
