-Kakaya difference between Suffix and Preffix Editor templates?

A : In fact, there is the opportunity to address select the type prikripleniya your message (from a template, etc.) Preffix letter at the beginning and end of the letter Suffix, respectively.

For IM only type prikripleniya Preffix.
Bulletin create a template for IM and create for appointment as it works when you ask for the job?

A : After the posting of the template, make the attribution of that template in the job;

Bot retrieves a list of messages and makes rassyl, and he makes SLUCHAYNUYU sample of these reports. If you make a change in the pattern already assigned task, this template will again be downloaded IRC.

moment I already have Panel but earlier versions as update it to version 1.3.2?

A : To begin, you will need to create a 3 new tables in a database, code can be placed in a file unker.sql, called it stat_down, stat_bot_rap and task_single then be Rebuild applies downfiles table. Then simply replace all the files on your files new version.

A : Urly set in a large box under "Url` s to load.

" Each new url must be put in a new line, that is, after each, must press Enter if given only one url, Enter rid NOT need.

-Skolko can ask urlov?

A : What you want, in reasonable measures. thing is the word [TASK] instead of country code?

A : This means that the country can not be used for new jobs because already she has an active job to appoint a new task is to remove old.

-Pochemu when I clicked on the job "delete", I have gone stata for files uploaded to the United States.

A : This was done to avoid conflicts with characters instalov and filenames.

- Why, when the Count to Install put a value of 2, urlov put 2 in the figure 4.

A : If you checked Sum. , then the panel will multiply the number urlov at Number instalov thus enjoy equal number for each urla.

- Why when the job is a country All other countries are not doing downloads.

A : The fact is that a download for all countries, the priority is given only to this target. Fauna calculated the percentage living stir?

A : The number of reports a day, the number stir. evaluates range between Kyrgyzstan.

-Today new bots : 1040All New bot today : 56 v 4em raznica?

A : The difference is that the first number of a range of time ie of a range between 34234234 and 3578666 (Unix format, the number of seconds from 1.01.1970), and if the first rap. falls on the range, then considered.

Second is the number (day, month, year), those. chosen to statistics, only boots, which further in the number of the second meter stable wedlock.
it is not dependent server to work with ranges of time.

-Posle click "Clear global"
