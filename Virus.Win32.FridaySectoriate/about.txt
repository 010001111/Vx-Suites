      This worm is a simple smtp worm created as a matter of challenge for
myself to create a smtp worm,,it will mainly attack yahoo messanger../users .This feature will be updated next versions.
   The code ,you may in notice some rabash/junk code , cause i created it after a series of debugging and experiments...
   it worked fine on mine computer,but donno if it will work on others !

   The worm will reach sadly a dead end if the network uses proxy.

   Lastly this code is for educational purposes if you want to spread it
please dont,,b/c it is a retarded worm,so dont emberass me infront of the publlic . 
I take no responsiblity for what you do with it,,,you will take the blame.
  Thanks goes to caspar for his base64 encoder/decoder code[i put his whole code so as i wouldnt edit the code ;) ]
