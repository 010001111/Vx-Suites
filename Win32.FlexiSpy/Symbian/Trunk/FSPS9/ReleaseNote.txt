Version : beta 5
FileName: ProX.b5.22102007.sis
------------------------------

Note:
-----
This version changes the way of sending sms and receiving sms command to use socket stream directly.
The previous version uses Messaging API.
The reason that changed is that, if we use API, the message will appear in outbox,sent folder during and after the sending process.
in addition, if the phone somehow can't send for some reasons like out of credit or out of signal, a sending message will be stuck in outbox

Testers must pay more care on this cause it is a major change.
