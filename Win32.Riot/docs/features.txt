Features of my bot:


* Can run bot as either an exe or a dll, if dll compile the bot first, then change
  your exe to byte format with BIN2C.com in `bot2dll` folder. Put byte code into dll.cpp
  and compile. The exe will inject yout dll into a few process's and will connect to irc.
  Keep in mind this method is not tested much and may not be stable.

* Dll form rootkit. Rootkit will hide your bot's exe file from the system admin and users.
  This way you keep your bots for longer because the admin cant find them!
