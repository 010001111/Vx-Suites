How to build this. Notes.

Important note on the steps for build process. Since we recently added build_dll project that requires a DLL assembled in
docfind_dll project, the projects have to be built in the following order:

Step one.
Build -> Batch build -> select all, except these two: build_dll DEBUG and build_dll RELEASE.

Step two.
The same thing, but reverse the selection - nothing except these to build_dll DEBUG and build_dll RELEASE.
