1) Installation
  a command should load the DLL and execute installation function
  
  1) for FF, Opera and IE searching for DDLs to replace
  2) new DLL name(the one to load) is embedded into our DLL. Kills all the processes, renames the DLL, replacing the original DLL with ours/

2) Loading process

  Idea - replace our DLL handle during loading by changing the return address of LoadLibraryExW function. The change will be done by our loader that will load our DLL.
  
If the loaded DLL address is not taken - do not load
  
Loaded DLL names are exchanged through PEB to enable correct methods operations with (LoadLibrary, GetModuleHandle) modules
  
1) The installer must
   - load bot.plug with embedded connection data
   - store encrypted in a random location
   - export a function to install in random locations (accepts a string with the list of destinations)
     - prepare DLL for saving (create a new DLL name, address)
	 - change DLL name for application
	 - save autorun DLL
	 
2) The autorun must
   - load with replacing the original with itself
   - receive bot.plug saved by the installer
   - decrypt, load into the memory and call Start function
