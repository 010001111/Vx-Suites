Installation

Make a folder in the admin: chmod 777 *-R
Go: http://host_admin/install/

Step 1: Choose a language

  Just select your language admin



2 Step: Check software
  
  Version of PHP: If red, the old version for the admin
  
  WebServer - Module mod_xsendfile:
    If the red:
      Not installed (not running) - here everything is clear

      Installed (not running) - This means that the module is installed but not working properly

        Types of solutions:
          Set in httpd.conf "XSendFilePath path_for_admin" (without the quotes)

          Set in the cache directory permissions 777 and all folders and subfolders, and files and files in folders

Perhaps with your server admin can not be downloaded.
Try to load on the server admin http://host_admin/accounts/check_download.html (eg with wget)
If the file is empty and / or long is the connection and then breaking it means the firewall or through the domain your server does not see himself.

  PHP - The module GeoIP Country:
      If the red:
        Not installed - This means that as GeoIP module is not installed and access to the portable version of the no.

  PHP - MySQLi module
      If the red:
        Is not set - no proper MySQLi module in php

  PHP - Module Zip:
      If the red:
        Is not set - no proper module in php Zip

  PHP - Module Pcntl:
      If the red:
        Is not set - no module required Pcntl in php
Check it over SSH, but not in phpinfo.

  May still be errors red:
      PHP - Function "name_function": no - this means that no php function desired. How to fix by Google in each case.




3 step: Checking write permission

  dir / file - no write access, it is not. - Means that there is no access to the file.
To be sure, and the speed is most easily done in the admin directory chmod 777 *-R
          Those who do not want and paranoia,
          can put all the admin user and group under which the web server and php
          and to give full write permissions for this user and group.
          The main thing is to understand the 777 is not required, be sure to have write access to their own files and folders.



4 step: MySQL
  Possible errors are:
    I can not connect to MySQL server - access to the database is invalid

    I can not create a procedure / function - you can not create the desired procedure / function.
      The code of the procedure / function appears above teksbokse, you need to copy and execute in the correct database!
      And then press F5 in your browser, or in any other way to update the page
      if the error is repeated so as it is not added to the procedure / function.

    The user does not have permission to write to the file. - For a given user has no permission to write to a file.
      Give your users rights to write to a file.
      Specific rights MySQL: FILE, GRANT (possibly)
      And then press F5 in your browser, or in any other way to update the page
      if the error is repeated so as something wrong and not what you do.
      If you do not like does not work there is a button "Skip", it threatens those that download data from the section "Filter" you will not be possible!




5 step: New jobs in cron
    Error:
     Can not add crowns job. - Add jobs in the crowns.
     It is very easy:
       Run through the shell: crontab-u root path_for_adm / cron_job (this command will be written in full browser)
       Then run through the shell: crontab-u root-l and if the answer is four lines with scripts admin area so everything is OK.
       Click the browser "Skip"
     
     If for some reason set in the crown is not to add it would entail,
     not working "import filters"
     auto start jabber client
     Auto Launch "in the search logs FG"
     auto optimization DB
     Not properly working unit / section "Plugins"



6 step: Complete
     Mistakes here can not be.
     Just click "Log in"
