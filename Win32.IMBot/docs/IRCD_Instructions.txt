*                 h1t3m IRCD                  *
*   h1t3m IRCD is fairly easy to configure    *
* and install, mostly just typing a few words *
*            and then hitting enter           *
***********************************************

Instructions:

Firstly you need to download the ircd from here: http://www.speedyshare.com/648623476.html

1) Get a shell over the server you are trying to install onto (eg bash or sh)
2) upload and untar ircd.tar to a new folder on the server (good folder is .src)
   to untar the file just use "tar xvf ircd.tar" you will see a new folder
   called ircd.
3) cd to ircd and hit ./Config and run through the configuration process.
   If you don't know the answer to any of the questions the default will do.
   In the tests i did i was able to get it to boot with fully default configuration.
4) If all went sucessfully then you will see a prompt telling you to hit make, so
   just type in "make" without the quotes and it will compile.
5) once compiled you will see another box apear telling you it has been completed.
   Now open unrealircd.conf with your favourite text editor (eg notepad) and change
   the values to what fits you best. A sample of what it all does is included at the end
   of this document.
6) Once you've edited unrealircd.conf to meet your needs, cd to the main dir (/ircd/)
   and type in "./unreal start" without the quotes. If you get any errors on the screen
   you have done something wrong in configuration and should start again.
   If it says that ircd was semingly not started, but didn't give you any errors on
   the screen, then it has probably started and just dosent realise this and i haven't
   been able to find whats bugged about it as of yet.
7) Now your done! Connect to your server on whatever port you put in unrealircd.conf and
   your good to go!


Notes:

* Remember that is is a modded ircd made for extra security. You will not be able to
  see how many users are connected or anything till your are opered, you won't
  even be able to see people in any chanels untill your are an operator, and you
  enter "/names #channel" without the quotes.

* To login to oper you need to use the following command "/oper nick password" without quotes.
* Only opers can preform whois's and channel listing.
* If you didn't get it from h1t3m.org it may be backdoored.


*************************************
* How to edit unrealircd.conf file! *
*************************************

[x] First open your unrealircd.conf file in notepad or whatever editer you are using.

    * The "owner" block specifies who the owner of the irc server is and what the main 
      server and info states. Edit this to something that fits your network.
    * The "Adminz" block specifies who the server admins are, just set this to your
      nick that you will be using.
    * The "Class" block tells the server some stats. The only thing you need to change
      is the max clients limit if you want more than 8000.
    * The "Allowz" line tells the server who to allow and who to block, you should
      leave this as is
    * the "listen" block specifies what ports to listen on for you to connect to.
      you can either just put 1 port (eg: 6667) or multiple ports (eg: 6665-6669) which
      would do all ports between 6665 and 6669.
    * The "operator" block is the most importent block, this specifies who the opers
      or IRCops are. On the line "oper nick {" replace the word "nick" with what your
      nickname on irc will be, then chane the line "userhost *@*;" To your userhost.
      (if you don't have a host use your ident [eg: botsmith@*])
      After that change "password "passhere";" so that "passhere" has the password you
      need to identify to oper.
    * The "settings" block is also very importent, you should edit this to fit your needs.
      Make sure you change the cloak-keys to something different. The line that reads
      "kline-address 	 "kline@h1t3m.org";" change the email to your kline email address.
    * The "log" block is just where ircd will log errors and such, just leave as is
    * The "other shit" block specifies the ulines and the motd/rules. All you need to edit
      is the stats and services server.
[x] Thats it, your done! Save the file and go to step 6 at the top of this document.
