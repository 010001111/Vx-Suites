Hi there!
This an instruction to setup Glimpse:
We have three units:
1. Agent:
	1.1. just run it in commandline and enjoy.
	but for better way we use a first level obfuscation: (rename all variables)
	1.2. "dns_main.ps1" is the main file and you can obfuscat it with "GlimpseGo" vs project
2. Panel:
	2.1. you should run newPanel exe file on windows os with .Net framework and then enjoy ;D
3. Server: for setting your server up you should do these:
	3.1. install nodejs: you can use:	https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/ (in linux servers it's better to update and upgrade before)
	3.2. create a folder for your server: here we use "home" folder
		- mkdir home
	3.3. copy the following file into home folder
		- srvr.js
	6. open cmd and go tho home folder and run the following commands in current folder "/home"
		npm init
			"let required inputs blanck or default and press Enter"
		npm install --save body-parser cookies child_process dnsd webix express ip fs path sqlite3 http portscanner child_process async ejs express-fileupload dateformat multer file-base64 flat-file-db moment busboy
		npm install --save -g forever
	7. at last run following command
		(in linux servers default dns server should be off*)
		forever start srvr.js
			
* if your linux default dns server is active do this:
sudo sed -i 's/^dns=dnsmasq/#&/' /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
sudo service network-manager restart
sudo service networking restart
sudo killall dnsmasq
