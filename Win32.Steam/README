Information about the usage;

Simply find a way to plant the compiled DLL file into /<STEAM PATH>/bin/,
the file extension of the DLL must be ".mix", this exploit was founded by
several other programmers in other circumstances and can be seen in a ton of 
programs using the "Miles Sound System", the exploit basically exploits the
Miles plugin system, it loads "plugins" as DLL files, and if the DLL file
does not match plugin specification it rejects it, we reject the rejection
(in FreeLibrary) so the library stays loaded, and that is our hole.
